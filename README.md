# Next.js 15 App Router: Silent Route Failure in Deeply Nested Structure

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router where deeply nested routes fail silently without any error messages.  Routes function correctly until a certain nesting level is reached, after which they stop working.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when using a deeply nested route structure within the app directory.  There are no errors reported in the console or development logs, and the page simply fails to render.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to deeply nested routes (e.g. `/level1/level2/level3...`) to observe the failure.

## Expected Behavior

Deeply nested routes should function correctly, with the appropriate page component rendering.

## Actual Behavior

After a certain nesting depth, routes fail to render without any error messages.

## Environment

* Next.js 15
* Node.js [Your Node.js Version]
* Operating System: [Your OS]

## Workaround

Currently, there isn't a known workaround apart from reducing the depth of the nested routes.
